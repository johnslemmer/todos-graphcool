# todos-graphcool

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Purpose

I always really enjoyed Meteor's [TODO tutorials](https://github.com/meteor/todos) back when I was learning their technology stack.
Even though I'm no longer currently utilizing the Meteor framework I often find myself
trying to recreate their TODOs tutorial to explore the ins and outs of some other
technology.  To see where the strengths and hold ups are.

This is my attempt to recreate the server-side database/API required to support
a front end TODOs app utilizing a graphcool-graphql technology stack.

I know working on a little project like this can help me figure out any hurdles
there would be to using a such technologies.  I hope my explorations prove
useful to others. And potentially act as a boilerplate for projects based
on such technologies.
