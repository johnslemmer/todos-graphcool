# todos-graphcool

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

The intention of this repo is to play around with graphcool technologies and figure out any hurdles there would be to using this technology to develop something bigger.  Also, doing a small project like this can be helpful in understanding what it takes to make a good boilerplate for such a project.
