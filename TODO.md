# TODO

## Priority

* Add a seed script
* Add unit testing for functions
* Add unit testing for permissions
* Documenting the API
* Documenting any caveats or gotchas with the technology stack

## To Achieve a Boilerplate

* Add linting
* Can I add Flow? I know graphcool already supports typescript.
but I'm just curious.
* Add Babel transpiling for more future features???? (not sure what graphcool deploy is doing, but it looks like it is doing some of this.)
* some standard NPM scripts to help with deployment and testing

## Exploratory

* Using graphcools file saving api
* Can graphcool node package be a devDependency instead of a global script requirement?
* adding and API gateway on top of this????
  * I think docs are still coming from graphcool
  * maybe needs to be run on some other servless backend??
  * if we want/need to change the CRUD api provided.
  * do we as long as the permissions are great???
