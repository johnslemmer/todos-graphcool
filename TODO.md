# TODO

* adding and API gateway on top of this????
  * I think docs are still coming from graphcool
  * maybe needs to be run on some other servless backend??
  * if we want/need to change the CRUD api provided.
  * do we as long as the permissions are great???
* shooting for a server side replica of: https://github.com/meteor/todos

Making a good graph cool boilerplate:

* Add linting
* Can I add Flow? I know graphcool already supports typescript.
but I'm just curious.
* Add testing for functions
* Add Babel transpiling for more future features???? (not sure what graphcool deploy is doing, but it looks like it is doing some of this.)
* some standard NPM scripts

Other things to play around with:

*  file system stuff
